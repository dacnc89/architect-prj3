Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - UDP
Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
Port 22 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
Port 22 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
Port 80 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
Port 5000 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- add specific IP address range to security group for port 22 and 65535 and 5000 to restrict unauthorized access.
