# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Remove SSH from Web instance
- Update SG to specific IP address from ALB SG
- Enable s3 encryption

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- Create VPC private won't help to secure S3 bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- No, only new data upload to bucket after changing to encryption will be applied.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- All change was made will lost, all states revert back like original version.
